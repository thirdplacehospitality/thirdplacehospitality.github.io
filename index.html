            <p>At Third Place Hospitality, we breathe new life into beloved neighborhood bars. We specialize in acquiring establishments from owners who are ready to retire, ensuring that their unique culture and character remain intact. Our hands-on approach and commitment to the spirit of the bar allow us to maintain the independence that makes these venues special while improving the guest experience. As operators first, we create lasting memories and foster a sense of community in every place we touch.</p>

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are bar operators who love the industry and want to help it grow and thrive. Spencer, our founder, left a comfortable career at Apple to pursue this passion, working his way up from part-time FOH employee to Beverage Director at a James Beard-finalist restaurant group. After a decade in the service industry, we're showing no signs of stopping, and we're ready to take the next step to support and curate welcoming, relaxing, and communal bar spaces.</p>

                <h2>Investment Strategy</h2>
                <p>We aren't a giant Private Equity firm. We aren't liquidating, flipping, or selling off assets for cash. We are Denver locals who work in the industry and understand the unique challenges it presents. Those challenges excite us, and we want to support as many independent bars as we can. If you're an owner looking to start your next chapter, but you want your employees taken care of and your culture maintained, drop us a line.</p>
